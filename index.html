<h1>Poem by William Shakespeare</h1>
<div id="introduction">
<h2>All the worlds a stage</h2>
</div>
<p>All the world's a stage,<br /> And all the men and women merely players;<br />They have their exits and their entrances,<br />And one man in his time plays many parts,<br />His acts being seven ages.</p>
<h2>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? (Sonnet 18)</h2>
</p>Hello world</p>
<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? <br />Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br />Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br />And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.<br /></p></p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br />And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br />And every fair from fair sometime declines,</p>
<div>
<p><strong>By chance</strong>, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;<br />But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br />Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br />Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.<br />So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br />So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
</div>
